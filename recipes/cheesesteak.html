        <h2>A delicious variation of the famous sandwich from the City of Brotherly Love</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients (4 sandwiches)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1-2 pounds ribeye steak, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
          <li>4 Hoagie rolls</li>
          <li>1 onion (large)</li>
          <li>8 slices of Cooper Sharp or other white American cheese</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice hoagie rolls 3/4 of the way through. Chop, dice, or slice onions and thinly slice beef (slightly frozen beef can be sliced easier.</li>
            <li>Add oil to your pan/cooktop and sautee onions until caramelized then transfer to bowl.</li>
            <li>Spread the super thinly sliced steak in an even layer onto cooktop. Let brown for a couple of minutes undisturbed then flip and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Sautee until steak is fully cooked through then stir in the caramelized onions.</li>
            <li>Divide into 4 even portions and top each with 2 slices of cheese and turn off the heat so the cheese will melt without overooking the meat.</li>
            <li>Place bun over each portion and use a spatula to scrape the cheesy beef into your bun as you flip it over. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
